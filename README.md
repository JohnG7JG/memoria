# memoria
Memoria is an information system created for nationwide application. It aims to eliminate bureaucracy and corruptness while ensuring the security of the data by unifying all the public sector services' platforms into one. This project was created for the "Software engineering" class at University of Macedonia taught by Alexander Chatzigeorgiou.

The system consists of 2 parts. A MySQL database and an Apache HTTP Server containing the web based GUI. Both were designed and implemented with modularity and abstraction as the main objectives.
