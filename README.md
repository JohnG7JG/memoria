# memoria
Memoria is an information system created for nationwide application. It aims to eliminate bureaucracy and corruptness while ensuring the security of the data by unifying all the public sector services' platforms into one. This project was created for the "Software engineering" class at University of Macedonia taught by Alexander Chatzigeorgiou.

# Generally

The system consists of 2 parts. A MySQL database and an Apache HTTP Server containing the web based GUI. Both were designed and implemented with modularity and abstraction as the main objectives.

# GUI

The web based interface consists of 5 basic panels that remain the same regardless the country of implementation, and 2 more, whose content varies depending on the country's respective public sector servants' activities and privilages. The GUI was created with raw html+php , having in mind the known hardware limitations of most coyntries' public sectors equipment. We also aimed for minimalism and simplicity of use in order to achieve the lowest possible learning curve, considering the technological illiteracy of the users that this system is aimed for.
